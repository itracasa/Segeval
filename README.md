# seg-eval

seg-eval is a Python library that provides tools for evaluating semantic segmentation models.

This library is associated to the paper **Guidelines to Compare Semantic Segmentation Maps at Different Resolutions**.


## What's inside

* Pixel-wise semantic segmentation metrics.
* Utilities to generate evaluation regions and to analyze segmentation results within them. 
* Functions to qualitatively analyze segmentation results and to generate figures for academic papers. 

# Installation

# Example notebooks

* [1. `Metrics` module: Pixel-wise semantic segmentation metrics.]()
* [2. `Region Metrics` module: Utilities to generate evaluation regions and to analyze segmentation results within them.]()

The `Visualization` module is used in both of the notebooks.

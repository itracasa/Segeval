# seg-eval

seg-eval is a Python library that provides tools for evaluating semantic segmentation models.

This library is associated to the paper **Guidelines to Compare Semantic Segmentation Maps at Different Resolutions**.


## What's inside

* Pixel-wise semantic segmentation metrics.
* Utilities to generate evaluation regions and to analyze segmentation results within them. 
* Functions to qualitatively analyze segmentation results and to generate figures for academic papers. 

# Installation

Since the package has not been converted into a pip installable package yet, you can install it by cloning this repository.

`git clone https://github.com/itracasa/seg-eval.git`

# Example notebooks

* [1. `metrics` module: Pixel-wise semantic segmentation metrics.](https://github.com/itracasa/seg-eval/blob/main/example_notebooks/1.%20Metrics%20module.ipynb)
* [2. `region_metrics` module: Utilities to generate evaluation regions and to analyze segmentation results within them.](https://github.com/itracasa/seg-eval/blob/main/example_notebooks/2.%20Region%20Metrics%20module.ipynb)

The `visualization` module is used in both of the notebooks.
